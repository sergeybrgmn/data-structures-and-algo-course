# Data Structures and Algorithms Course practice

Highly recommend this course

What I have learned, repeated or structurized in my memory:
1) About big O notation. 
    * Great link provided for memo https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/
    * As well as Python time comlexity https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity

2) The list-based data sctuctures (collections): 
    * List, 
    * [Linked list](LinkedList.py) - how to use classes to define the element object and the head of the LL, 
    * Queue, 
    * Stack

3) Sort and searching algorithms
    * [Binary search](Binarys.py) - how the efficiency could be improved from O(n)->O(log(n))
    * Always possible to use a result table to calculate Efficiency
    * Recursion with great [Fibonacci](Fib.py) example
    * [Quick sort](Quick_sort.py) algorithm

4) Maps and hashing
    * [Dicts](Dicts.py) - the practice was easy, so made a class to fill the dict
    * Hash functions (no practice), how to deal with collisions
    * [Hash table](Hashmap.py) created for the string inputs

5) Treeees
    * Terminology, traversal logic, Depth-First Traverse, BFS
    * [Binary tree](Bin_tree.py) Practice to traverse a binary tree in different order (Pre- and Post-)
    * [BST](BST.py) binary tree insert and search practice
    * Heap - no practice

6) Graph
    * [Graph representation](Graph_repr.py) 
    * [Graph traversal](Graph_trav.py) - the task was skipped. Plan to return later
